    <h2>Early life</h2>

    <p>Neymar was born in Mogi das Cruzes, São Paulo, to Neymar Santos Sr. and Nadine da Silva and had a Christian
      upbringing. He inherited his name from his father, who is a former footballer and became his son's advisor as
      Neymar's talents began to grow. Neymar comments on his father's role: "My father has been by my side since I was
      little. He takes care of things, my finances and my family." Growing up, Neymar combined his love of futsal with
      street football. Neymar said that futsal had a massive influence on him growing up, helping him develop his
      technique, speed of thought and ability to perform moves in tight spaces.

      In 2003, Neymar moved with his family to São Vicente, where he began playing for youth side Portuguesa Santista.
      Then, later in 2003, they moved to Santos, where Neymar joined Santos. With the success of his youth career and
      added income, the family bought their first property, a house next to Vila Belmiro, Santos' home stadium. Their
      quality of family life improved, as at age 15, Neymar was earning 10,000 reais per month and at 16, 125,000 reais
      per month. At 17, he signed his first full professional contract, was upgraded to the Santos first team, and began
      signing his first sponsorship deals. </p>

    <h2>Career</h2>

    <p>Neymar made his professional debut with Santos in 2009. In 2011, he helped them win their first Copa Libertadores
      in nearly 50 years. In 2013, he joined Barcelona and became part of an attacking trio with Lionel Messi and
      Luis Suárez, dubbed MSN. Winning the continental treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the Champions League in
      the trio's first season, Neymar was the joint-top goalscorer of the Champions League campaign and top goalscorer
      of the Copa del Rey. In his final season, Neymar reached 100 goals for Barcelona and set the record for most
      assists in a Champions League campaign.Motivated to assume focal responsibility, Neymar joined Paris Saint-Germain
      (PSG) in 2017 for a transfer worth €222 million, making him the most expensive player ever. He largely
      contributed to PSG's continuation of Ligue 1 title dominance, earning the Player of the Year in his debut season
      and being named in the Team of the Year three times. In the Champions League, he was integral to PSG reaching its
      first final in 2020 and established himself as the highest-scoring Brazilian in the competition. Whilst one of the
      club's highest ever scorers, continuing injuries caused PSG to sell Neymar in 2023 to Al Hilal for €90 million, a
      Saudi Pro League record transfer. Despite playing a limited number of games due to a year-long ACL injury, he was
      part of the squad that won the 2023–24 league title. He returned to his boyhood club Santos in January 2025.</p>
